    <h5 class="card-title">Hi there.</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
      I'm a self taught Web Developer/ Software Engineer. I'd always held an interest in coding and around 2018 I decided
      to try and teach myself some basics. Realising how much I loved it I delved head-first into an open source
      full stack developer course in an attempt to turn a hobby into a career.

      I've now put together a portfolio of work but my main focus is always to keep learning and add more tools
      to my skillset.
